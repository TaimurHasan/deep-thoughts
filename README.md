<br/>
Deep Thoughts is an online social network, which allows a user to create an account and start posting 'thoughts' and 'reactions'. This project uses JWT user authentication to ensure that only password-protected accounts are able to make, edit, and delete posts or comments. The application also allows users to add other users as friends! <br/>

Note: passwords are encrypted using the bcrypt npm package!
